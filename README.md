# DataModel Visualizer

## Why this tool?

In the PLM world and more globally in other software projects, the datamodel is key.

Currently, the 3DExperience cloud does not provide a simple way to visualize the datamodel out of the box, and custom configured or deployed on a tenant.

There are no graph visualizations of the objects or links between objects.

We can export several configurations files in XML and Json that are not comprehensive by a human being.

## The Proposal

The goal of this project is to provide a simple way to generate a comprehensive list of custom properties and UML schemas. This will allow you to discuss your datamodel with your team, customers, and other stakeholders more effectively.

## Help Me!

## Let Me Help

Please raise issues or contact me if you have any requests or need help. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.

## Inspiration

When I started working on 3DExperience, I was shocked by the lack of open-source or community projects. I have worked on Aras and other projects and was inspired by the incredible work of:

- Eric Domke on an Aras Administration tool open source: [InnovatorAdmin](https://github.com/erdomke/InnovatorAdmin/tree/mastern
- Vincent Daburon on JMeter: [vdaburon]https://github.com/vdaburon
- Olivier De Meringo on sustainable projects: [demeringo]https://github.com/demeringo

Big applause to them and long live their projects.
